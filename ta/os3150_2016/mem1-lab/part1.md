#  Measurement of cache misses and TLB misses

This part briefly describes how to measure cache misses and TLB misses:
* use [*perf*](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) to  access the hardware performance counters





<br><br>
**Important Note**:

Please run *perf* on department **linux9** servers. Because VirtualBox can **NOT**
support *perf* though *perf* can be installed on VM successfully.
